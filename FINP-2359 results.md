**Comments**

Re-opening. Github closed PR 1425 when I merged 1426. Something buggy / I don't understand. Anyhow, I'll need to re-do the PR for this one.
Looks like github closed 1425 because I had the same commit (and removal) on 1426. Still dumb behavior. Anyhow, I re-created the PR for this story as 1427.

To keep in mind next time: Keep my PRs clean!
