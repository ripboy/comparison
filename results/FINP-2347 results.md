**Comments**
I put a PR out there to fix this one. This is different then FINP-2331 in that I'm adding the versionNumber to every framework generated inquiry in KFS, if the BO has a versionNumber. The upshot of the solution is that it would also fix FINP-2348. The downside is that to fix this problem in IE we now would pass the versionNumber for every inquiry in KFS.

Lets see what the tech team thinks of this solution.
I should add that my generic solution on this subtask wouldn't make the solution on FINP-2331 redundant since FINP-2331 deals with an inquiry that isn't generic -- it was coded on the JSP.
Yay!  :fingerscrossed:
